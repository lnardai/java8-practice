# Java 8 practice excercise

The goal of this project is to provide some easy to do practice with 8 streams and it's feature.
Topics like creating streams, map, filter, foreach, reducers, collectors, groupby, partition, etc.

# How to do the practice

You will find 3 classes inside `com.practice.stream` and their respective unit tests under the test directory.
The master branch holds the solution for the unit tests. The practice branch was stubbed 
with UnsupportedOperationExceptions() so you can write your own implementation. 2 more difficult unit test classes were @Ignore 
for easier progress tracking.

Suggested order to solve:

1. BasicStreamAggregateService
2. BasicStreamTransformationService
3. AdvancedStreamService

You can always take a peek at the master branch, but I suggest to rely on it as a last resort.

Good luck!
